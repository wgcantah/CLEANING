- CLEANING is an R package mainly for checking and removal of outliers from data set. It helps to make the identification and deletion of outliers from data frame much more easier.

The goal of CLEANING is to reduce the stress associated with the identification and removal of Outliers from Data Frames. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of CLEANING like so:

``` {r}
library(devtools)
#install_github("wgcantah/CLEANING")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CLEANING)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r}
df <- data.frame( id = 1:10, 
                  value = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100), 
                  category = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B") 
                  ) 
# Generate Z-scores for the 'value' column 
z_score_df <- zscore(df, "value")
# View the data frame with Z-scores 
print(z_score_df)

# Normalize the numeric columns using Z-score normalization 
normalized_df <- normalise(df) 
# View the normalized data frame 
print(normalized_df)
```
